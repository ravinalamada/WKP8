.1 I built form in the html and then I styled them in the style.css file. I grabed form and ul element. Then, I generated hmtl which will show the items. Then I created an empty array and I pushed the items in it. Afetr that, I created function that increment the score of the songs. After that, I deleted the items.

2. If I had more times, I would finish my project because there are lots o things that I couldn't finish.

3. Yes, I did learn many things such us incrementing the score of the song.

4. Filter the tilte song and the style also to icrement the score.

5. It was such a big challenge for me because there lots of new things, however I still enjoyed doing it so much. Thank you for structuring it. It is so kind of you.
